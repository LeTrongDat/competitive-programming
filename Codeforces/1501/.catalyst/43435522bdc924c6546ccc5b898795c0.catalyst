Alexey and Train","contestId":"1501","problemIndex":"A","timeLimit":"1 second","memLimit":"256 megabytes","inputFormat":"standard input","outputFormat":"standard output","problemHtml":"<p>Alexey is travelling on a train. Unfortunately, due to the bad weather, the train moves slower that it should!</p><p>Alexey took the train at the railroad terminal. Let&apos;s say that the train starts from the terminal at the moment $$$0$$$. Also, let&apos;s say that the train will visit $$$n$$$ stations numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ along its way, and that Alexey destination is the station $$$n$$$.</p><p>Alexey learned from the train schedule $$$n$$$ integer pairs $$$(a_i, b_i)$$$ where $$$a_i$$$ is the expected time of train&apos;s arrival at the $$$i$$$-th station and $$$b_i$$$ is the expected time of departure.</p><p>Also, using all information he has, Alexey was able to calculate $$$n$$$ integers $$$tm_1, tm_2, \\dots, tm_n$$$ where $$$tm_i$$$ is the extra time the train need to travel from the station $$$i - 1$$$ to the station $$$i$$$. Formally, the train needs exactly $$$a_i - b_{i-1} + tm_i$$$ time to travel from station $$$i - 1$$$ to station $$$i$$$ (if $$$i = 1$$$ then $$$b_0$$$ is the moment the train leave the terminal, and it&apos;s equal to $$$0$$$).</p><p>The train leaves the station $$$i$$$, if both conditions are met: </p><ol> <li> it&apos;s on the station for at least $$$\\left\\lceil \\frac{b_i - a_i}{2} \\right\\rceil$$$ units of time (division with ceiling); </li><li> current time $$$\\ge b_i$$$. </li></ol><p></p><p>Since Alexey spent all his energy on prediction of time delays, help him to calculate the time of <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">arrival</span> at the station $$$n$$$.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$)&#xA0;&#x2014; the number of test cases.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains the single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$)&#xA0;&#x2014; the number of stations.</p><p>Next $$$n$$$ lines contain two integers each: $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i &lt; b_i \\le 10^6$$$). It&apos;s guaranteed that $$$b_i &lt; a_{i+1}$$$. </p><p>Next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$tm_1, tm_2, \\dots, tm_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le tm_i \\le 10^6$$$).</p>","outSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Output</div><p>For each test case, print one integer&#xA0;&#x2014; the time of Alexey&apos;s arrival at the last station.</p>","noteHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Note</div><p>In the first test case, Alexey arrives at station $$$1$$$ without any delay at the moment $$$a_1 = 2$$$ (since $$$tm_1 = 0$$$). After that, he departs at moment $$$b_1 = 4$$$. Finally, he arrives at station $$$2$$$ with $$$tm_2 = 2$$$ extra time, or at the moment $$$12$$$.</p><p>In the second test case, Alexey arrives at the first station with $$$tm_1 = 1$$$ extra time, or at moment $$$2$$$. The train, from one side, should stay at the station at least $$$\\left\\lceil \\frac{b_1 - a_1}{2} \\right\\rceil = 2$$$ units of time and from the other side should depart not earlier than at moment $$$b_1 = 4$$$. As a result, the trains departs right at the moment $$$4$$$.</p><p>Using the same logic, we can figure out that the train arrives at the second station at the moment $$$9$$$ and departs at the moment $$$10$$$; at the third station: arrives at $$$14$$$ and departs at $$$15$$$; at the fourth: arrives at $$$22$$$ and departs at $$$23$$$. And, finally, arrives at the fifth station at $$$32$$$.</p>","sampleTestcases":[{"id":1616247339754,"input":"2\n2\n2 4\n10 12\n0 2\n5\n1 4\n7 8\n9 10\n13 15\n19 20\n1 2 3 4 5\n","output":"12\n32\n"}],"submitUrl":"https://codeforces.com/contest/1501/submit","language":"c++"}
